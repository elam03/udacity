# Udacity
This is my Udacity Full Stack Developer course work progress.

## Projects
My bigger, course-ending projects are located in the sub-folder 'projects'. As I finish my projects I will try and tag them for easier organization.

All source code will be located here: [github](https://github.com/elam03/udacity)

### Completed projects
 * Movie-Trailer [tag](https://github.com/elam03/udacity/releases/tag/movie-trailer)

## Lessons
As I continue my courses/lessons, I will be putting my scribbles/notes in the 'lessons' sub-folder.

## Notes
This sub-folder is for other notes/learnings as I continue my lessons.
